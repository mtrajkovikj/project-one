  <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>My name is Marko Trajkovikj. I am 19 years old (turning 20 in November). I was born in Republic of Macedonia and I moved to the us in September 2015. I am a first year ITM student at IIT. I still don't know what I would like to specialize in, but hopefully it will come to me as time passes by. I live in Highland Park and commute daily.</p>

    <h4>Working out</h4>
      <p><i>"Mens sana in corpore sano"</i> - Latin for "a healthy mind in a healthy body". Now ain't this a good saying?!</p>
      <p>As I got older and older, I switched from unhealthy snacks, sandwiches (still can't turn down a good burger lol), candy &amp; other similar foods, into, salads (hated them as a youngster), veggies, fruits, protein-rich foods etc. Now, my eye for aesthetics accompanied by my will for a healthy life, resulted in me willing to work out. I can't just look at the mirror and be satisfied with what I see because I know that everything can be even better than it is now, not only body related but in every aspect of life. Man, I <strong>love</strong> working out... And I think that everyone should. You don't have to be a massive sized "chiffonier", not being able to scratch your own back, but being physically (don't forget psychically) active brings you numerous health benefits.</p>

    <h4>Video editing</h4>
      <p>Since the time that I used to play Counter Strike, I got interested in video editing. Now, Counter Strike and video editing don't seem related anyhow, but they are related in the movie-making gamer's world. I used to record short clips of my gameplay and edit them with special visual and audio effects, synced with the music so they would look amazing and uploaded them on YouTube afterwards. An example of the kind of edits I am talking about is below.</p>

      <p>My YouTube channel broke the guidelines of the website, resulting in it's termination, so I laid low for a while and stopped playing games in the meantime.</p>
